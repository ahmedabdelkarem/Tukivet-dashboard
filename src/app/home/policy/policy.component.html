        Welcome to TowqiVet!
        We understand that the planning and booking of veterinary services and consultations may involve unforeseen
        situations requiring cancellations or adjustments. In order to provide a clear and fair experience for all our
        users, we have established the following cancellation and refund policy. This policy seeks to balance our
        clients' need for flexibility with the professional commitment of our veterinary service providers. We invite
        you to read these terms carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities when booking services through
        our platform.

        <p>
          1. TECHNICAL MALFUNCTIONS DURING THE SESSION
          In the event of experiencing technical problems that prevent the proper conduct of a booked session, the
          client should immediately contact the customer service team to attempt to resolve the problem. If the
          technical issue cannot be resolved and significantly affects the quality of the session, the client is
          entitled to request compensation, which may include rescheduling the session at no additional cost.

        </p>
        <p>
          2. VOLUNTARY SESSION TERMINATION BY THE CLIENT
          If the client decides to terminate an ongoing session for any reason not attributable to the platform or the
          provider, the client shall not be entitled to a refund of the session fee or any part thereof. Likewise, once
          the session has ended, it is not possible to request a refund.

        </p>
        <p>
          3. CANCELLATION BY THE PROVIDER
          If the provider cancels a booking, the client shall have the option of transferring the booking to another
          provider available on the platform or requesting a full refund of the session. The client's preference in this
          regard shall be communicated to the platform within a reasonable timeframe.


        </p>
        <p>
          4. CANCELLATIONS WITHIN PACKAGE OFFERS
          In the event that the client wishes to cancel one or more sessions within a package booking offer, the amount
          corresponding to the cancelled sessions will be non-refundable. In addition, cancelled sessions within a
          package will not be rescheduled.

        </p>
        <p>
          5. BANK ACCOUNT REFUND PROCESS
          If the client requests a refund to their bank account, this process may take between 21 and 30 working days,
          depending on the bank's policies and the platform's internal procedures.

        </p>
        <p>

          6. TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION PRIOR TO SESSION
          The client is entitled to a full refund if the client experiences a technical malfunction of the platform that
          prevents the start of the booked session. To do so, the client must immediately notify the technical team and
          provide supporting evidence of the technical problem.


        </p>
        <p>
          7. CLAIMS AND DISPUTE
          In the event of disputes or complaints relating to the services provided, the client must first contact the
          provider to seek resolution. If a satisfactory agreement is not reached, the client may escalate the dispute
          to the platform for mediation.

        </p>
        <p>
          8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
          The platform reserves the right to modify this cancellation and refund policy at any time. Any changes to the
          policy will be communicated to users in a timely manner. By making a booking, clients accept and agree to be
          bound by the terms and conditions of this policy.

          3. PROVIDERS
          3.1. Registration
          By registering as a provider on our platform, you agree to provide veterinary services and consultations in
          accordance with applicable regulations and professional standards. It is your responsibility to ensure that
          all information provided on the platform is accurate, up-to-date and accurately reflects your qualifications
          and services offered. Providers agree to use our platform exclusively for professional purposes and in
          accordance with applicable laws. In addition, they undertake to respect the booking schedules agreed with
          clients and to provide a high quality service. The platform acts as an intermediary between providers and
          clients, but is not responsible for direct interactions and the quality of the service provided. Providers are
          obliged to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information of clients to which they have access
          through the platform.
          Providers may share personal and commercial information through the platform with other users. Any information
          that providers share through the platform is the sole responsibility of the providers themselves. Providers
          are free to share information, but are responsible for the use of such information, its publication and
          disclosure. TowqiVet is not responsible for the information published and shared through the platform. The
          information you provide and publish through the platform may be visible to the general public.
          3.2. Account
          If you register with TowqiVet, you will be asked to choose a password and you may be asked for additional
          information about your account according to the registration form available on the platform. You are
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account information, and are fully
          responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify
          TowqiVet of any unauthorised use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure
          that you log out from your account at the end of each session. You may never use another user’s account
          without prior authorisation from TowqiVet. TowqiVet will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
          your failure to comply with this agreement.
          Users may cancel their accounts at any time and for any reason through the account settings or by sending us
          their request through our contact information. Such cancellation will only result in the deletion of the
          account and the deletion of all personal data provided to TowqiVet.
          TowqiVet reserves the right to terminate your account or your access immediately, with or without notice, and
          without liability to you, if TowqiVet believes that you have violated any of these terms, provided TowqiVet
          with false or misleading information, or interfered with another user's use of the platform or service.
          3.3. Services and Consultations
          As a registered provider on our platform, you have the option to offer virtual veterinary consultations in
          addition to face-to-face services. By accepting a booking for a virtual consultation, you agree to conduct the
          session through the digital means provided by our platform, guaranteeing the expected quality and
          professionalism of the service. You must ensure that you have a stable internet connection and the necessary
          equipment to carry out such consultations effectively. Providers are expected to confirm bookings virtually
          within a reasonable period of time and to keep their availability updated to avoid scheduling conflicts. In
          case of cancellation or rescheduling of a confirmed virtual consultation, the provider must inform the client
          in advance, offering alternative rescheduling options. The platform is not responsible for cancellations or
          changes to bookings made by providers, but will monitor the quality and consistency of the service offered in
          virtual mode and will take appropriate action in case of repeated complaints or non-compliance.
          3.4. Package Offers
          Providers have the possibility to offer packages of sessions to clients. These packages can include a number
          of services or veterinary consultations bundled together at a total price that represents an incentive
          compared to contracting these services individually. Providers are free to determine the content, number of
          sessions, duration and price of these packages, while respecting applicable professional standards and
          regulations.
          By offering a package of sessions, the provider commits to deliver all services included in the package in a
          satisfactory manner and within the agreed timeframe. The specific details of each package, as well as the
          conditions of use and cancellation, must be clearly communicated to clients prior to purchase.
          TowqiVet reserves the right to review and approve session packages proposed by providers to ensure that they
          comply with our policies and quality standards. In addition, the platform may offer assistance in the
          promotion and management of these packages, but is not responsible for any direct contractual obligations
          between the provider and the client arising from the purchase of these packages.
          Providers are responsible for any claims or disputes arising in relation to the packages offered, and must
          handle these situations in accordance with the platform's policies and applicable law."
          3.5. Commissions and Withdrawals
          As a provider on our platform, you agree that, for each service or consultation booked by customers and
          successfully provided by you, a commission will be deducted. This commission will be calculated as a
          percentage of the total price of the successfully completed service or consultation, and will be automatically
          withheld from the payment made by the client. The specific percentage of the commission, together with any
          future changes to it, will be communicated in advance to the providers.
          The remaining amount, after deduction of the commission, will be credited to your provider account on the
          platform. You will be free to request withdrawal of these accumulated funds at any time, subject to our
          withdrawal conditions and processes, which include security and identity verification measures to protect both
          the provider and the platform.
          We reserve the right to withhold or delay withdrawals in situations of suspected fraud or breach of our terms
          and conditions. In addition, we are committed to maintaining clear and consistent communication about any
          adjustments to commission and withdrawal policies. Each provider is responsible for complying with applicable
          tax regulations on income earned through our platform.
          3.6. User Content
          Providers may provide and upload content and information through the platform. Providers retain any copyright
          or other rights they may have in the content and information they provide through the platform. TowqiVet is
          not responsible for the accuracy, safety or legality of the content posted on the platform by the providers.
          The provider is solely and exclusively responsible for its content and the consequences of its publication. By
          providing content and information through the platform, the provider grants TowqiVet a worldwide,
          non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up right and license to host, store, transfer, perform, reproduce and
          modify the provider's content for the sole purpose of using and displaying it within the platform and to the
          general public.
          3.7. User Content Representations and Warranties
          TowqiVet disclaims all liability in connection with the content of the provider. The provider is solely and
          exclusively responsible for its content and the consequences of providing content through the platform. By
          providing and uploading content through the platform, you affirm, represent and warrant that:
          a) You are the owner of the content you provide through the platform, or have the necessary licenses, rights,
          consents and permissions to authorise TowqiVet to publish and display your content through the platform.
          b) Your user content, and the use of your user content as contemplated by these terms, does not and will not
          (i) infringe, violate or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent,
          trade secret, moral right, right of privacy, right of publicity or any other intellectual property or
          proprietary right; (ii) libels, defames, slanders, libels or invades the right of privacy, publicity or other
          proprietary rights of any other person; or (iii) causes TowqiVet to violate any law or regulation.
          c) Your content could not be considered by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent,
          pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful or otherwise inappropriate.
          d) Your content may not contain gambling, games or contests based on chance.
          e) Your content does not and will not contain hateful content, threat of physical harm or harassment.
          3.8. Monitoring of Content
          TowqiVet may, at any time and without notice, filter, remove, edit or block any provider content that, in our
          sole judgment, violates these terms or is otherwise objectionable. If any user or third party notifies us that
          provider content allegedly does not conform to these terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in
          our sole discretion whether to remove the relevant provider content, which we reserve the right to do at any
          time without notice. Provider acknowledges and agrees that TowqiVet reserves the right to, and may from time
          to time, monitor all information transmitted or received through the Platform for operational and other
          purposes.




        </p>
        <p>
          4. CLIENTS
          4.1. Account
          If you register on TowqiVet, you will be required to choose a password, and you may be asked for additional
          information regarding your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password
          and account information, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or
          account. You agree to (a) immediately notify TowqiVet of any unauthorised use of your password or account or
          any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session.
          You may never use another user’s account without prior authorisation from TowqiVet. TowqiVet will not be
          liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this agreement.
          Users may cancel their accounts at any time and for any reason through the account settings or by sending us
          their request through our contact information. Such cancellation will only result in the deletion of the
          account and the deletion of all personal data provided to TowqiVet.
          TowqiVet reserves the right to terminate your account or your access immediately, with or without notice to
          you, and without liability to you, if TowqiVet believes that you have breached any of these terms, furnished
          TowqiVet with false or misleading information, or interfered with use of the platform or the service by
          others.
          4.2. Booking of Services and Consultations
          By using our platform to book veterinary services and consultations, clients agree to follow the established
          procedures for making such bookings. This includes providing accurate and complete information required for
          the booking and adhering to the specified payment policies.
          To make a booking, the client must select the relevant service and complete the booking process in the
          relevant provider's profile. Once the service is selected, the client must select the date and time of the
          session. Please check the service specifications and availability of dates and times for each service before
          making a booking. Once a booking is confirmed, clients agree to adhere to the agreed dates and times for
          services or consultations.
          The platform strives to ensure the quality and reliability of the providers and their services, but is not
          responsible for the individual acts of the providers or for the direct consequences of the veterinary services
          received. Clients should make their own assessments of the suitability of providers prior to making bookings.
          Clients accept that any dispute relating to the quality of service received should initially be taken up with
          the provider. However, the platform offers a support and mediation system to assist in the resolution of such
          disputes, always seeking a fair and reasonable solution for both parties.
          Furthermore, clients accept that the platform may collect and use data related to their bookings and
          preferences to improve the quality of the service offered and for future communications related to services or
          promotions, always respecting the privacy and personal data protection policy.
          4.3. Package Offers
          TowqiVet offers clients the possibility to purchase packages of veterinary service sessions provided by our
          registered providers. These packages consist of a set of services or consultations offered at a bundled price,
          which may be more beneficial compared to purchasing them individually.
          By purchasing a package of sessions, the client agrees to abide by the specific terms and conditions set forth
          by the provider, including the nature of the services offered, the number of sessions, their duration and the
          total price of the package. It is the client's responsibility to review and understand these conditions prior
          to purchase.
          Once a package is purchased, the client agrees that cancellations or modifications to sessions are subject to
          the provider's specific policies, which include limitations on refunds and rescheduling. Details of these
          policies must be provided by the provider and be clearly visible to the client prior to the purchase of the
          package.
          Clients should note that if all sessions included in the package are not used within the validity period
          specified by the provider, they will not be entitled to refunds for unused sessions. Please refer to our
          refund and cancellation policy.
          4.4. Payments
          Clients agree to make payment for service reservations and consultations through the platform using authorised
          payment methods, including credit and debit cards. By making a booking, the client authorises the platform to
          charge the full amount of the service or consultation to the credit or debit card provided.
          Clients are expected to ensure that their payment card details are valid and sufficient to cover the cost of
          the service or consultation booked. In the event that payment cannot be processed due to incorrect
          information, insufficient funds or any other problem related to the client's account, the booking may be
          cancelled by the platform.
          Clients should be aware that once payment has been made, they will be subject to the platform's cancellation
          and refund policies. These policies will be available for review prior to confirming the reservation and
          payment.
          The platform implements security measures to protect payment card information and ensure secure transactions.
          However, clients acknowledge and accept that no security system is foolproof and that the platform is not
          responsible for any unauthorised access to such information by third parties.
          Clients by making payments through the platform, accept and adhere to the terms of use of the payment
          processing service, and understand that any disputes related to payment transactions must be resolved in
          accordance with the policies of such service.

          5. CODE OF CONDUCT
          TowqiVet is committed to maintaining a respectful, safe and professional environment for all its users, both
          clients and providers. Therefore, we establish the following codes of conduct that all users must follow:
          • Mutual Respect: Users must interact with each other in a respectful manner, avoiding offensive comments,
          discrimination, harassment or any form of disrespectful behaviour.
          • Clear and Honest Communication: Users must provide truthful and complete information, both in their profiles
          and in their communications. Misinformation, deception or concealment of relevant information is strictly
          prohibited.
          • Confidentiality and Privacy: Users must respect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information
          shared through the platform. Any misuse of confidential information will be sanctioned.
          • Regulatory Compliance: Providers must adhere to all applicable professional and legal regulations in the
          provision of their services. Clients must comply with the platform policies and conditions agreed upon when
          booking services.
          • No Advertising or Spam: The use of the platform for the distribution of unsolicited advertising, spam or any
          unauthorised promotional content is prohibited.
          TowqiVet reserves the right to take action, including account suspension or termination, for any violation of
          these codes of conduct. These actions seek to preserve the integrity and quality of the service offered and to
          protect our user community."

          6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
          The platform acts as an intermediary between clients and veterinary service providers, facilitating the
          booking and payment of veterinary services. While we strive to ensure the quality and reliability of the
          providers registered on our platform, we assume no responsibility for the services provided directly by these
          providers. The platform does not guarantee the accuracy, efficacy, or quality of the services provided by the
          providers, nor is it responsible for any damage, loss or harm that may arise from the use of the same.
          Clients acknowledge and agree that contracting services through the platform is done at their own risk. The
          platform is not responsible for any act, omission, advice, treatment or diagnosis made by the providers.
          Clients must exercise their own judgement in selecting a provider and in following any recommendations or
          treatment suggested by them.
          Furthermore, the platform is not responsible for the cancellation or modification of services by providers,
          nor for disputes that may arise between clients and providers. In the event of a dispute, the responsibility
          lies directly with the provider and the client involved.
          The platform shall also not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
          including but not limited to, loss of profits, data or other intangible losses resulting from the use or
          inability to use the services offered on the platform.
          This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law and shall survive the termination

          7. ADVERTISING
          Through the platform, TowqiVet may make available to users, commercial and advertising information, own or
          third parties in accordance with good business practices. In these cases, TowqiVet does not endorse, guarantee
          or commit its responsibility for the services and/or products marketed by these third parties, since the
          platform serves as a channel of communication and advertising, but not as a tool for the provision of
          services. Consequently, it is the full responsibility of the users to access the sites that refer advertising,
          assuming the obligation to verify and know the terms of the services offered by third parties.

          purposes of the platform. The user may NOT use the chat or messaging service available on the platform to
          perform any of the following actions:
          • Send messages that are defamatory, violent, profane, harassing, obscene, threatening or messages that

          condones or promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any individual or group of
          individuals.
          • Use the platform to collect personal data from users.
          Any breach or violation of the provisions contained in these terms may result in the suspension of the
          offending user's account, with or without notice and without the right to compensation.


        </p>
        <p>
          9. FEEDBACK SYSTEM
          The platform will have a feedback system, in which users will be able to evaluate each other once the service

          responsibility. TowqiVet does not control or modify the comments made by providers or clients or the
          evaluations made by providers or users at the end of the bookings and services. Clients and providers are
          solely responsible for the content and comments they publish on the platform.
